  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "What is Paperwall?",
    "a1": "Paperwall is an open protocol that enables micropayments for web content — letting readers pay tiny amounts (as low as one penny) per article. No subscriptions needed. Anyone can build on it, run their own infrastructure, or just use Kobaru's implementation.",
    "q2": "How much does it cost?",
    "a2": "Publishers set their own prices. Most articles cost between $0.01 and $0.10. A $5 deposit can last months.",
    "q3": "Is my money safe?",
    "a3": "Your funds are stored in an encrypted wallet on your device. Only you can access them with your password.",
    "q4": "How do publishers get paid?",
    "a4": "Instantly. When you pay for an article, the publisher receives the money right away. No waiting 30-60 days like traditional ad networks.",
    "q5": "What about AI agents?",
    "a5": "AI agents can use our CLI tool to automatically pay for and access content. Perfect for research, data gathering, and automated workflows.",
    "q6": "Do I need cryptocurrency knowledge?",
    "a6": "For readers: we're doing everything we can to abstract crypto complexity and deliver a state-of-the-art UX. One of our core principles is the grandma test — the extension should be so easy to use that even your grandma can use it. That said, Paperwall is in early stages, and users will need to fund their account manually. We'll guide you through the process with simple, step-by-step instructions. For publishers: Kobaru abstracts everything. No crypto knowledge needed — just add a script tag and you're done.",
    "q7": "What if I don't like an article I paid for?",
    "a7": "At one penny per article, the risk is minimal. And we're currently developing allowlists and denylists — so you'll be able to set up automatic payments for publishers you trust and block ones you don't, without ever having to think about it.",
    "q8": "Is Paperwall open source?",
    "a8": "Yes. Paperwall is an open-source protocol licensed under GPL-3.0. You can inspect the code, contribute, fork it, or run your own instance entirely independent of Kobaru.",
    "q9": "Which browsers are supported?",
    "a9": "Currently Chrome and Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, Arc). Firefox and Safari support is on our roadmap.",
    "q10": "How do I add Paperwall to my website?",
    "a10": "Add a single script tag to your HTML. It takes less than 60 seconds. Check the 'For Publishers' section above for details."

    "articleTitle": "The Future of Micropayments",
    "articlePreview": "What if you could pay a penny to read any article on the internet? No subscriptions, no ads, no tracking. Just a tiny payment and instant access.",
    "articleBody1": "For decades, the web has been stuck in a broken monetization cycle. Publishers plaster their sites with ads, users install ad-blockers, and everyone loses. Subscriptions emerged as an alternative, but they create their own problems — subscription fatigue, paywalls that block casual readers, and an internet increasingly divided between those who pay and those who don’t.",
    "articleBody2": "Micropayments offer a third path. Imagine paying just one cent to read a single article. At that price, a $5 deposit lasts for 500 articles — months of reading for most people. Publishers earn more per reader than they would from ads, and readers get a clean, ad-free experience without committing to monthly subscriptions.",
    "articleBody3": "The technology finally exists to make this work. Ultra-low-fee blockchain networks like SKALE have reduced transaction costs to near zero, making sub-cent payments economically viable for the first time. Combined with the x402 protocol — which brings native payments to HTTP — we now have the infrastructure for a web where content creators are fairly compensated and readers pay only for what they consume.",
    "articleBody4": "This is what the Paperwall protocol enables. One script tag for publishers. One browser extension for readers. One CLI tool for AI agents. An open, composable toolkit that turns the promise of micropayments into reality — and that anyone can build on, extend, or self-host."

    "backHome": "← Back to home",
    "lastUpdated": "Last updated: February 24, 2026",
    "overviewTitle": "1. Overview",
    "overviewBody": "Paperwall is a free, open-source micropayment protocol for web content. It consists of a publisher SDK, a Chrome browser extension, and a CLI agent with an A2A (agent-to-agent) server. By using any Paperwall software, you agree to these terms.",
    "protocolTitle": "2. The Protocol",
    "protocolBody": "Paperwall is an open protocol licensed under GPL-3.0. Anyone can inspect, fork, modify, or self-host the software. There is no central authority controlling the protocol. Kobaru operates a reference implementation — including the facilitator service at gateway.kobaru.io — but you are free to run your own infrastructure.",
    "walletTitle": "3. Your Wallet",
    "walletBody": "When you use the Chrome extension or CLI agent, a crypto wallet is created on your device. Your private keys are encrypted locally and never leave your device unless you explicitly export them. You are solely responsible for securing your password and any backup of your private keys. Lost keys cannot be recovered by Kobaru or anyone else.",
    "paymentsTitle": "4. Payments",
    "paymentsBody": "Payments are made in USDC on the SKALE network. When you approve a payment, you sign an EIP-712 authorization that allows a facilitator to submit the transfer on-chain. Transactions are final and irreversible. Publishers set their own prices. Paperwall does not take a cut from content payments.",
    "facilitatorTitle": "5. Facilitator Service",
    "facilitatorBody": "Kobaru operates a default facilitator service that processes payment settlements. The facilitator submits signed authorizations to the blockchain on behalf of users. Facilitators may charge processing fees. You can choose to use a different facilitator or run your own.",
    "openSourceTitle": "6. Open Source",
    "openSourceBody": "All Paperwall software is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0. You may use, modify, and distribute it under the terms of that license. The source code is available at github.com/kobaru-io/paperwall.",
    "disclaimerTitle": "7. Disclaimer",
    "disclaimerBody": "Paperwall software is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind. Kobaru is not liable for any loss of funds, failed transactions, or damages arising from the use of the protocol, extension, CLI agent, or facilitator service. Cryptocurrency transactions carry inherent risks including price volatility and smart contract vulnerabilities.",
    "changesTitle": "8. Changes to These Terms",
    "changesBody": "We may update these terms as the protocol evolves. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. Continued use of Paperwall software after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.",

    "backHome": "← Back to home",
    "lastUpdated": "Last updated: February 24, 2026",
    "overviewTitle": "1. Our Approach",
    "overviewBody": "Paperwall is designed to work without collecting personal data. There are no accounts, no email addresses, no tracking pixels, and no analytics cookies. We believe you should be able to pay for content without giving up your privacy.",
    "extensionTitle": "2. Chrome Extension",
    "extensionBody": "The Paperwall Chrome extension stores your encrypted wallet and payment history locally in chrome.storage.local on your device. Your private keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a password you choose — this password is never stored or transmitted; it is used only to derive the encryption key locally. Decrypted keys exist only in chrome.storage.session (in memory) while the extension is active. Payment history includes the URLs and origins of sites where you made payments, the amounts paid, and transaction hashes — this data is stored locally only and capped at 1,000 records. No data is sent to Kobaru or any third party except when you explicitly approve a payment — at which point only the signed payment authorization is sent to the facilitator for on-chain settlement.",
    "agentTitle": "3. CLI Agent & A2A Server",
    "agentBody": "The CLI agent stores wallet data, payment history, budget configuration, and receipts as local files in ~/.paperwall/ with restricted permissions (0600). Private keys can optionally be stored in your operating system's keychain (macOS Keychain, GNOME Keyring, or Windows Credential Manager). No data is sent externally except payment authorizations when you fetch paywalled content.",
    "websiteTitle": "4. This Website",
    "websiteBody": "The paperwall.app website does not use cookies, analytics, or tracking scripts. It is a static site that does not collect any visitor data. No personal information is required to use any part of the website.",
    "blockchainTitle": "5. Blockchain Transactions",
    "blockchainBody": "Payments are settled on the SKALE blockchain. Blockchain transactions are public by nature — anyone can see the sender address, receiver address, and amount. However, Paperwall does not link wallet addresses to real-world identities. Your wallet address is pseudonymous.",
    "thirdPartyTitle": "6. Third-Party Services",
    "thirdPartyBody": "When using the default facilitator (gateway.kobaru.io), payment authorizations are sent to Kobaru's server for on-chain settlement. The facilitator processes the transaction data needed to submit it to the blockchain — sender address, receiver address, amount, and cryptographic signature. No additional personal data is collected. Publishers who receive your payments see only your wallet address and the payment amount.",
    "changesTitle": "7. Changes to This Policy",
    "changesBody": "If we change this privacy policy, we will update this page with the new policy and date. Since Paperwall is open source, you can always review the actual data handling in the source code.",
    "contactTitle": "8. Contact",
    "contactBody": "For privacy-related questions, open an issue at github.com/kobaru-io/paperwall or reach out at kobaru.io."
