# Paperwall
> Micropayments for the open web. Pay a penny to read an article.

## About
Paperwall is an open-source micropayment toolkit for web content.
Publishers add one script tag. Readers pay pennies. AI agents use a CLI.
Built by Kobaru. Licensed under GPL-3.0.

- Homepage: https://paperwall.app
- Demo: https://paperwall.app/demo
- GitHub: https://github.com/kobaru/paperwall
- npm SDK: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paperwall/sdk
- npm CLI: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kobaru/paperwall
- Documentation: https://github.com/kobaru/paperwall/tree/main/docs

## How it works
1. Publisher adds a single <script> tag to their website
2. Reader pays pennies (as low as $0.01) via browser extension
3. Content unlocks instantly. Publisher gets paid immediately.

The system uses the x402 protocol, which brings native payments to HTTP.
Payments are processed on the SKALE blockchain network, which has ultra-low
transaction fees, making sub-cent payments economically viable.

Payment flow: Reader signs an EIP-712 typed data message. A facilitator
service submits the transaction on-chain using EIP-3009
TransferWithAuthorization. The reader never needs to interact with the
blockchain directly.

## For Publishers
Add one line of code to your HTML:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@paperwall/sdk/dist/index.iife.js"
  data-facilitator-url="https://gateway.kobaru.io"
  data-pay-to="YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS"
  data-price="10000"
  data-network="eip155:324705682"
></script>
```

- `data-pay-to`: Your Ethereum wallet address (receives USDC payments)
- `data-price`: Price in USDC micro-units (10000 = $0.01)
- `data-network`: CAIP-2 network ID (default is SKALE Base Sepolia testnet)
- `data-facilitator-url`: Payment processing endpoint

The SDK is ~5 KB and works with any website. No backend needed.
Wrap your paywalled content in a div with id="paperwall-content".

## For Readers
1. Install the Paperwall Chrome extension
2. Create a wallet (password-protected, encrypted on your device)
3. Deposit USDC (as little as $5 = 500 articles at $0.01 each)
4. Browse the web normally. When you hit a paywalled article, click "Pay" in the extension popup
5. Content unlocks instantly

Supported browsers: Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc (all Chromium-based).
Firefox and Safari support is on the roadmap.

Your wallet is encrypted with PBKDF2 (600k iterations) + AES-256-GCM.
Only you can access your funds with your password.

## For AI Agents
Install the CLI globally:
```
npm install -g @kobaru/paperwall
```

Set up a wallet:
```
paperwall wallet create
```

Fetch paywalled content:
```
paperwall fetch <url> --max-price 0.05
```

Run as an A2A (Agent-to-Agent) server:
```
paperwall serve --port 4000
```

The CLI also works as an MCP server for AI assistants like Claude Code:
```
paperwall mcp
```

Key CLI commands:
- `paperwall fetch <url>` — fetch a URL, paying if needed

- `paperwall wallet balance` — check wallet balance

- `PAPERWALL_ACCESS_KEYS` — comma-separated Bearer tokens for server auth
