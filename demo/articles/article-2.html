            Every transaction on a blockchain costs something. On Ethereum mainnet, that cost can
            range from a few cents during quiet periods to tens of dollars during network congestion.
            For applications processing high-value transactions &mdash; DeFi trades, NFT sales,
            cross-border remittances &mdash; these fees are a rounding error. But for a new class
            of applications built around sub-cent value transfer, gas fees are a death sentence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider a micropayment of $0.01. On Ethereum mainnet, the gas fee to execute a simple
            ERC-20 transfer would typically cost between $0.50 and $5.00. The fee is 50x to 500x
            the value being transferred. No business model can survive those economics.
          </p>

          <h2>The SKALE Approach</h2>

          <p>
            SKALE Network takes a fundamentally different approach to the gas fee problem. Rather
            than trying to minimize fees through batching or optimistic rollups, SKALE eliminates
            them entirely for end users. The network achieves this through a validator-subsidized
            model where gas costs are absorbed at the infrastructure level.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each SKALE chain is a dedicated, application-specific blockchain with its own set of
            validators. These validators are compensated through SKL token staking rewards, not
            through per-transaction gas fees. The result is that every transaction on a SKALE
            chain costs ultra-low fees &mdash; the user pays minimal amounts beyond the value they
            intend to transfer.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            "Ultra-low fees mean minimal cost. The network
            infrastructure absorbs most of the marginal cost, not each individual transaction. It enables models that
            make micropayments viable &mdash; the infrastructure absorbs the overhead."
            &mdash; Jack O'Holleran, SKALE Labs
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>

          <p>
            Under the hood, SKALE chains run a modified version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine
            (EVM), which means developers can deploy standard Solidity smart contracts without
            modification. This EVM compatibility is critical for adoption &mdash; it means existing
            token contracts (like USDC) can be deployed on SKALE with zero code changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each SKALE chain is secured by a randomly rotating subset of the SKALE validator pool.
            Validators are selected using a combination of stake weight and randomness, making it
            economically infeasible for any single entity to compromise a chain. The security model
            is comparable to a well-funded proof-of-stake Layer 1, but with the performance
            characteristics of an application-specific chain.
          </p>

          <h2>The Micropayment Use Case</h2>

          <p>
            The ultra-low-fee model is particularly transformative for micropayments. When processing a
            $0.01 payment, the economics are straightforward: the sender spends $0.01, the receiver
            gets nearly $0.01, and the network fee is minimal. This near-100% efficiency ratio is unprecedented
            in digital payments and makes previously impossible business models viable.
          </p>

          <h3>Stablecoin Settlement</h3>

          <p>
            Most micropayment applications on SKALE use USDC as the settlement currency. USDC
            provides the price stability needed for commercial transactions &mdash; neither the
            publisher nor the reader wants to deal with the volatility of native tokens. The USDC
            contract deployed on SKALE chains supports the same ERC-20 interface as mainnet USDC,
            along with EIP-3009 for gasless approvals.
          </p>

          <h3>Throughput and Latency</h3>

          <p>
            SKALE chains can process up to 400 transactions per second with block times of
            approximately one second. For micropayment applications, this means payments confirm
            in about a second &mdash; fast enough to feel instantaneous to the user. At 400 TPS,
            a single SKALE chain could process over 34 million transactions per day, more than
            enough for even the most popular content platforms.
          </p>

          <h2>Challenges and Limitations</h2>

          <p>
            The ultra-low-fee model is not without trade-offs. Because validators are not heavily compensated
            per-transaction, the economic incentives for validation come largely from SKL staking
            rewards. If the value of SKL were to decline significantly, the security budget of the
            network could be affected.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, the application-specific chain model means that each deployment has its
            own token bridge and liquidity pool. Moving USDC from Ethereum mainnet to a SKALE
            chain requires a bridge transaction, which itself costs mainnet gas. However, for
            micropayment use cases, users typically bridge once and then make many small transactions,
            amortizing the bridge cost over hundreds of payments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite these limitations, the ultra-low-fee model represents a genuine breakthrough for
            micropayment applications. For the first time, the infrastructure exists to process
            penny-level transactions without the fees consuming the payment.
